# Problem with the array 
-> Either the size is fixed and preallocated(in both fixed and variable size array ) Or worst case insertion at the end is O(n).
(it is solved by dynamic size array like vector in c++)
->Insertion in the middle or begining or deletion is costly.
->Implemention of data structures like queue and deque is complex with arrays.

# Advantage of linked list over Arrays 
-> The idea is to drop the contiguous memory requirements so that insertion,deletion can efficiently happen at the middle also.
->No need to pre-allocate the space.
